This project series walks you through the process of building a real estate price prediction website. We start by creating a model using Scikit-learn and linear regression, using the Bangalore home prices dataset sourced from Kaggle.com.

Step 1: Model Building
In this step, we employ Scikit-learn to construct a powerful predictive model based on the Bangalore home prices dataset. The model will help us forecast real estate prices with accuracy and reliability.

Step 2: Python Flask Server
Once the model is trained and ready, we proceed to develop a Python Flask server. This server will serve as the backend, handling incoming HTTP requests and utilizing the pre-trained model to provide real-time predictions.

Step 3: Website Development
The heart of this project lies in creating an interactive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website's user-friendly interface allows users to input details like home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. Upon submission, the website interacts with the Python Flask server to retrieve and display the predicted property price.
